# Machine-Learning
+ In this homework you are going to apply supervised learning: Linear Regression method using Scikit-learn package; Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn].
